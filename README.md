# AI-Regression-Project

This project utilized the Bike Sharing dataset, this dataset comprised of temporal, weather, and behavioural features from 2011 to 2012. This dataset was made by Hadi Fanaee-T who gathered data from the Capital Bikeshare system. The purpose of this project was to develop a regression model to accurately predict bike usage. This information can be useful for many reasons, resource allocation, city planning and supporting operational decisions. For the project the models evaluated were, Extra Trees Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Linear Regression and Ridge Regression. Out of the selected models, the Extra Trees Regressor performed the best and was the model of choice for the rest of the project. The model achieved a high RÂ² of 0.9499, indicating that it explained approximately 95% of the variance in bike rentals. It's MAE and RMSE were also really good at 25.31 and 40.90 respectively. Showing such strong results, it can be argued that this model would be a highly reliable source for predicting bike rental demand.
